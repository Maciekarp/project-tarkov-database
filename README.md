# Takov DB
![](https://github.com/UMBC-CMSC461-SP2022/project-tarkov-database/tree/main/SampleImages)

## Project Description
This is a simple python app that provides an interface to populate and query a
database containing data from the game Escape from Tarkov

This project uses a docker mariadb image that can be accessed with the python scripts

## How to setup
To run this you must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), 
[MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/community/),
and [MariaDB Python Connector](https://mariadb.com/downloads/connectors/connectors-data-access/python-connector) installed on your system

Also buildDB requires [The JSON files](https://github.com/TarkovTracker/tarkovdata) to populate the database in case this data is no longer available `data-dump.sql` contains the whole database at the time of creating this project

First a MariaDB database must be started to do so in the command prompt run:

`docker run -p 3306:3306 -d --name mariadb -eMARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=Password123! mariadb/server:10.4`

The `port` and `password` can be changed if needed but any changes must also be changed in config.py
so the Python connector can access the database

Then you must connect to the instance to create the tarkovdata database this can be done running the lines:

`mariadb --host 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 --user root -pPassword123!`

`CREATE DATABASE tarkovdata;`

Next make sure all the required packages are installed by running the command

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
<!--`pip freeze > requirements.txt`-->
<!--`mysqldump -u root -p tarkovdata > data-dump.sql` -->
Now that everything is done you simply have to run the app by moving to the directory it is in and running:

`python3 tarkovDBApp.py`
